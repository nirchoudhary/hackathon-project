What is an algorithm, and why is it important?


<h1/>
<p class = "text-bg"><p class= "speak">

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or
perform a task. It's crucial because it helps in systematically solving
problems, automating tasks, and improving efficiency in various fields like
computer science, mathematics, and engineering.

What factors are considered when designing algorithms?
<h1/>
<p class = "text-bg"><p class= "speak">

When designing algorithms, key factors to consider include:
Correctness: Ensuring the algorithm produces the right output for all possible
inputs.
Efficiency: Optimizing the algorithm to minimize time and space
requirements.
Readability: Making the algorithm easy to understand and maintain.
Scalability: Ensuring the algorithm can handle larger inputs without
significant performance degradation.

What are the different types of algorithmic approaches?
<h1/>
<p class = "text-bg"><p class= "speak">

>> Algorithms can be categorized into various approaches, including:

>> Brute Force: Trying all possible solutions until the correct one is found.

>> Greedy: Making the locally optimal choice at each step to find the global
optimum.

>>Divide and Conquer: Breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems,
solving them independently, and combining their solutions.

>>Dynamic Programming: Breaking down a problem into smaller overlapping
sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once, storing the results to
avoid redundant computations
